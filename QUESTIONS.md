Just a compilation of David's questions during development xD He is a noobie, never really developed one.

* How to hide sensitive files in built version but still run?
* When it says, u have to handle through server-side/backend side --> does it mean this? show openAIAPI & ResponsiveVoice (this loads up the file tho?) and it also loads up the API_KEY
* Handle the code on server --> build a server itself?
* Is there anything I am missing?
