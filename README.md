# Chatty Chatty

This is a repo for a friendly chatty chatty bot. One of my first completed full stack application so there should be a few mistakes or inefficient coding!

## Important Notes

* This is a **duo-repo** setup, which means you have to install dependencies for each repo: *server* & *client.*
* I included a README.md for each repo (for serverless right now nothing), please follow the setup instructions OR you can setup from the root folder by running Setup steps

## Setup

`npm run setup:deps`

## Run locally (after proper installation)

`npm run dev`

## Build

`netlify link` & Choose the first option of GitHub

`npm run build`

## Deploy

`npm run deploy:dev`

OR

`npm run deploy:prod`
